## Features

As previously said, the app is relatively simple, the goal was not to reproduce a complexe application like [the Google IO app](https://github.com/google/iosched) but a very simple one, focused on the minimum tasks. (And created within a weekend)

The app contains:
 * A schedule listing
 * The conference's details view
 * An option to favorite talks

And you can also:
 * Navigate to the conference site
 * Give feedback on the organization
 * Press the refresh button to look again at the VectorDrawable animations
